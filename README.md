# Proxify Manual Testing Project

## Project Overview
Proxify is a service that connects clients with professional developers for hire. The website ([Proxify Dashboard](https://proxify.gg/dashboard)) offers different plans based on client needs, including part-time, full-time, and project-based development work. This project involves conducting manual testing on the Proxify website and documenting various test artifacts.

## Scope of Testing
The scope of manual testing covers the following modules:

- **Dashboard**: Verifying navigation, UI elements, and data consistency.
- **Plans**: Ensuring correct display of different plans with accurate details.
- **Invoices**: Checking invoice generation, download functionality, and data correctness.
- **Top-up**: Validating payment processing system and transaction records.
- **Referrals**: Testing referral links, earnings calculations, and copy link functionality.

## Testing Approach
A structured manual testing approach is followed, including:

- **Functional Testing**: Ensuring each feature works as expected.
- **UI/UX Testing**: Checking for design consistency, responsiveness, and user experience.
- **Regression Testing**: Verifying that new changes do not introduce defects.
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Testing input fields with minimum and maximum values.
- **Error Handling Testing**: Checking system response to invalid inputs and unexpected scenarios.

## Agile Methodology in Testing
The testing process follows Agile methodology to ensure continuous and iterative testing:

- **Sprint-based Testing**: Testing activities divided into multiple sprints.
- **Daily Stand-up Meetings**: Discussing test progress, blockers, and solutions.
- **Collaboration with Developers**: Continuous integration with the development team.
- **Frequent Builds & Releases**: Ensuring testing is performed on updated builds.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Conducting ad-hoc testing to uncover hidden defects.
